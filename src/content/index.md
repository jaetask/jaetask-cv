## A living breathing CV

On the surface this looks like a very simple website, there's some content, a few links, a blog post etc.. it appears basic but under the hood there is something very different going on. 

### A modern website in &lt;= 14Kb
This website loads in a single page request. In fact it loads in less than that. There are no external dependencies, no external images, no css files, no javascript files.. nothing. And what's crazy is that this is a fully responsive, modern, client side, JavaScript single page application that supports routing, a blog, Markdown page content.

And yes.. It's [open source via github](https://github.com/jaetask/minimal-14kb-website) too. What's the point of having an interactive CV if employers can't look at the code. 


### Why 14Kb?
